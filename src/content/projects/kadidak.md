Kadidak is a project that started as a startup idea from a group of students
and a professor at the University of Trento. The platform was designed to
give teachers new innovative tools to teach and students new ways to learn.
Key features of the platform were privacy, security, and accessibility. Our
team took part in <span class="mark tsv">Trentino Startup Valley</span> in 2022.
The MVP you can see here consist of a tool to create and do interactive quizzes:
teacher has the ability to create the quizzes in advance and everything is realtime.
Students do not require any account to do the quizzes. It is currently in test
phase with a group of students and teachers.

I was the lead in the frontend development of the project. I was in charge
of the design, which is all built from the ground up, and the implementation
of the frontend. I also set up a Figma library for the team to use.
