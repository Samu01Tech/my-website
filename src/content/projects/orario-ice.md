Orario ICE is a Progressive Web App that allows students to access the links to
the videocalls of their courses. It is built with <span class="mark vue">Nuxt.js</span> and it is
deployed on Netlify. I created this project to help my friends and me to access more quickly the lessons
during the pandemic. It recived a lot of positive feedback from the students.
